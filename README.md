# Cartoons Glitch - Psych engine
A fork of [Psych Engine](https://gamebanana.com/mods/309789) made for the mod Cartoons Glitch V1.

This engine is dead, is no longer updated, and will not be used in next pibby's mods.

## Installation:
You must have [the most up-to-date version of Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/), seriously, stop using 4.1.5, it misses some stuff.

Follow a Psych Engine source code compilation tutorial, make sure to install the correct LuaJIT.

To install LuaJIT do this: `haxelib git linc_luajit https://github.com/nebulazorua/linc_luajit ` on a Command prompt/PowerShell

...Or if you don't want your mod to be able to run .lua scripts, delete the "LUA_ALLOWED" line on Project.xml
